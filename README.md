# LUChess2.0

I previously created Chess in Java: https://github.com/LucF120/LUChess

I decided to complete this task again in a functional language (Racket) when I
had some free time. It's also been a few years since LUChess 1.0, so I'm
hoping to create a much better implementation this time around!
